# Sorter-App-Implementing-Design-Principles-With-Typescript-Using-Abstract-Classes-and-Interfaces
This is a simple sorting app that can sort a number array, string or a linked list. Although interfaces were used to make the code re-usable in the beginning, abstract classes seemed more fit for the ovrerall purpose of the app.

Clone the repo and install the dependencies with npm install. Run npm start.
